  After unlocking the dungeon, a man at the front approaches you and offers you a game. This game will help boost your stats if you are able to get under the average nmber of guesses of other players before you.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `Main.java`: the driver code for the program

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
